## 📌 Project Overview

This is a Python-based card game project designed as a **coding challenge for BeCode**. The primary goal is to **practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** while creating a functional card game that distributes a deck among players and plays cards turn by turn.

## 🎯 Features
✅ Generate a full deck of **52 playing cards**  
✅ Distribute the deck evenly among players  
✅ Players **play one card per turn** until they have none left  

### **Future improvements**
🚀 Make the game **interactive**, allowing players to pick which card to play  
🚀 Implement **point-based scoring** to determine a winner  
🚀 Introduce **game-over conditions**  

## Set up
Be sure to run on Python version 3.13.2

## Personal Situation
This project was part of an OOP consolidation challenge at BeCode. The goal was to improve clean code architecture, structured project design, and object inheritance while practicing Python development. Through this challenge, I reinforced my understanding of classes, data handling, and imports in a structured Python project.
