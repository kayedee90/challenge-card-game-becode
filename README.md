# Challenge Card Game - BeCode

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This is a Python-based card game project designed as a **coding challenge for BeCode**. The primary goal is to **practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** while creating a functional card game that distributes a deck among players and plays cards turn by turn.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
âœ… Generate a full deck of **52 playing cards**  
âœ… Distribute the deck evenly among players
